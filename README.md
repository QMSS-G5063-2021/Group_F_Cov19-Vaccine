# Introduction and Proposal:
“The trumpet of a prophecy! Oh Wind,  <br>
If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?”

The rampant epidemic has brought huge and painful consequences to human society. However, as Shelley's "Ode to the west wind" said, the dark and cold winter of human society will eventually pass, and the ongoing vaccination is undoubtedly a powerful light to illuminate the dark.

Our group wants to use the data visualization knowledge learned in class to track the speed of vaccination in each state of the United States. We hope to use some interactive means to present a variety of relevant information on the map, such as the vaccination rate in different states, the number of vaccinated people, the proportion of people who only received one dose in the total number of vaccinated people, and so on.

We hope that through this assignment, ourselves and others can learn more about the progress of vaccination. We also hope to bring more confidence and courage to fight the epidemic for all.
